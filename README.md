# agri_food_emission

Introduction

Carbon dioxide emissions from the agri-food sector contribute a substantial portion of the global annual emissions, and are significant when studying climate change. It is important to understand the environmental impact of the food industry. One relevant aspect is to understand the spatial distribution and the temporal trends of emission from the agri-food sector. 

# Key Questions and Objectives

● Which countries produce the highest/lowest amount of total CO2 emission?

● Which countries produce the highest/lowets per capita emission?

● Does the total amount of CO2 emission prodution show an increasing/decreasing ternd?

● Does the global level per capita emission show increasing/decreasing trend?

# Data set

A data set that contains information on CO2 emission from the agri-food sectors of countries across the globe. The source of the data set is
